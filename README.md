# Programming-Exercises
This repository is a compliation of various programming challenge problems and my solutions to them. Most solutions will be written in Java, but I may use other languages on occasion. The problems will come from various online sources such as [TopCoder](https://www.topcoder.com), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and [DailyProgrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer).

## Format
Each folder contains two files: a problem and a solution. The problem will either be in plain text format or HTML, with the latter being used if the problem cannot be properly displayed in a text file. If the problem is in HTML, you will need to download the file and open it with the browser of your choice. The source for the problem will be listed at the top of each problem file.

## Disclaimer
I am not claming that all of the solutions I provide are 100% optimal. It may very well be the case that many of my solutions could be improved in one way or another, so it is possible that you will come up with a different way to solve these problems if you attempt them yourself. This is simply a way for me to keep an archive of problems that I find interesting and to provide my interpretation of the solution.
